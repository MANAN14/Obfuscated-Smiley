# Obfuscated-Smiley
It is an old obfuscated code which I made in java. The original code is present in [here](https://code.sololearn.com/cLMGmXxmHRAx/?ref=app).

Input : Integer input,best works in 9 to 13

Sample Input: 9

It uses the equation of straight line, circle and parabola to make a smiley shape, but the source code
is obfuscated which will make it hard to understand.
